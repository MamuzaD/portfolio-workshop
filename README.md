## Workshop Overview

During the workshop, we covered the following topics:

- **HTML Basics:** Semantic HTML elements (header, nav, main, section, etc.), structure of webpages, element tags (opening/closing/void), common elements (h1-h6, p, a, br, img), divs & containers, and nesting concepts.
- **CSS Fundamentals:** Selectors (element, class, id), box model (content, padding, border, margin), layouts including block elements and Flexbox. We introduced CSS Grid but didn't have time for animations and variables.
- **Development Tools:** VSCode with extensions like Live Server for real-time previewing of changes.
- **Version Control with Git and GitHub:** BConnecting local repositories to remote GitHub repositories via VSCode. Did not go over basics of Git Commands (due to audience's previous experience).
- **Deployment:** Setting up static site deployment using GitHub Pages to make your portfolio accessible online.

## Available Templates
Three different templates were showcased during the workshop:

1. **Basic Version** - A simple portfolio template with separate pages for projects and about sections
2. **Two-Column Version** - A clean two-column layout portfolio template
3. **Bento Version** - A modern bento-grid style portfolio template

Choose the one that best fits your style or use them as inspiration to create your own design!

## Working with the Templates
Each template folder contains everything you need to get started:

- `index.html` - The main HTML file for the template
  - Basic includes sub folders which are pages such as `/projects` & `/about`
- `styles.css` - The CSS styling for the template
- Additional assets and folders specific to each template

Simply edit the files to customize with your own information, projects, and styling.
